# WeatherService README

Welcome to the WeatherService! This service provides weather forecast data for cities. Below is the detailed documentation of the HTTP endpoints available in the service.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Weather Forecast by City

- **Description**: Retrieves the weather forecast for a specified city. If no forecast is found, a new forecast will be generated and saved.
  
#### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                 |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------|
| city      | string | The name of the city to fetch the weather for. |

#### Response

- **Content**: Returns a WeatherForecast object.

##### WeatherForecast Object
```json
{
  "city": "string",
  "date": "DateOnly",

  "summary": "Sunny"
}
```

### Behavior

1. When a request is made to retrieve a weather forecast for a specific city:
   - The service will first check if a forecast exists in the repository.
   - If found, it returns the existing forecast.
   - If no forecast is found, the service will:
     - Generate a new weather forecast using a randomized temperature generator.
     - Save the new forecast in the repository.
     - Return the generated forecast to the requester.

---

## New Feature: Generating New Forecasts

This service now includes the capability to generate new weather forecasts. The functionality is integrated within the endpoint for fetching a forecast. The random temperature generation ensures unique and non-repeated data for each request where no prior forecast exists.

---

## Code Structure

### Controllers

- **WeatherForecastController**: Handles HTTP requests related to weather forecasts.

### Services

- **WeatherForecastGenerator**: Contains logic to generate random weather forecasts based on city input.

### Data Access

- **WeatherRepository**: Responsible for data operations related to weather forecasts.
