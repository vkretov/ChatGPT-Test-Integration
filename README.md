## Updates

### Recent Changes

- **README Updates**: The README has been updated to reflect the latest changes and enhancements in the project.
- **Debug Logs Added**: Debug logging has been implemented in the changelog generation script to provide better visibility into the generated content. This will help developers track changes easily.

### Changelog Script Updates

- The `generate_and_update_changelog.py` script now includes debug logs that print the generated content from the API response, aiding in troubleshooting and verifying the output process.

```python
print(response.choices[0].message.content.strip())
```

### Workflow Adjustments

- The GitHub Actions workflow for updating the changelog has been modified:
  - The branch naming convention for changelog updates has changed from `update-changelog` to `update-docs` for clarity.
  - Both `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` are now updated together in a single commit, promoting better documentation practices.
  - The pull request title and body have been adjusted to indicate updates to both files.

### Updated Commands

Here's how the workflow alters the previous commands:

```yaml
# Branch name changed
BRANCH_NAME="update-docs-$(date +%s)"

# Modified git commands for staging and committing
git add CHANGELOG.md README.md
git commit -m "Update CHANGELOG.md and README.md with new entries"
```
