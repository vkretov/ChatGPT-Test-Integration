### Revert Changes
- **Reverted**: Pull request [#17](https://github.com/vkretov/ChatGPT-Test-Integration/pull/17) "test - delete workflows"
  
### Updated Workflows
- **Restored Workflows**:
  - Readded the **Code Review with ChatGPT** workflow in `.github/workflows/code_review.yml`:
    - This workflow triggers on pull request events (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`) and pushes to the main branch.
    - It includes steps to check out the code, set up Python, install dependencies, and execute a code review using ChatGPT.
  
  - Readded the **Update Changelog** workflow in `.github/workflows/update_changelog.yml`:
    - This workflow triggers on pushes to the main branch.
    - It includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Python, installing dependencies, fetching the pull request number, generating and updating the changelog, and finally creating a new branch with the changes and opening a pull request for the updates. 

These changes restore the workflows that were previously removed, enhancing automation and maintaining a proper changelog.
