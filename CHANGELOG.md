### Revert Changes
- **Reverted**: Pull request [#17](https://github.com/vkretov/ChatGPT-Test-Integration/pull/17) "test - delete workflows"
  
### Updated Workflows
- **Restored Workflows**:
  - Readded the **Code Review with ChatGPT** workflow in `.github/workflows/code_review.yml`:
    - This workflow triggers on pull request events (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`) and pushes to the main branch.
    - It includes steps to check out the code, set up Python, install dependencies, and execute a code review using ChatGPT.
  
  - Readded the **Update Changelog** workflow in `.github/workflows/update_changelog.yml`:
    - This workflow triggers on pushes to the main branch.
    - It includes steps for checking out the code, setting up Python, installing dependencies, fetching the pull request number, generating and updating the changelog, and finally creating a new branch with the changes and opening a pull request for the updates. 

These changes restore the workflows that were previously removed, enhancing automation and maintaining a proper changelog.


# Changelog Update

## Version [Insert Version Here] - [Insert Date Here]

### Changes
- Updated workflow to now not only update the `CHANGELOG.md` file but also the `README.md` file based on the details of pull requests.

### Details
- The script has been modified to include a new function `generate_update_content`, which generates update content based on the type (changelog or README) along with the pull request differences.
- The `update_file` function now handles updates for both `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md`. It checks if the files exist, creates them if they do not, and appends the new content read from the pull request.
- The existing content of `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` is retained, ensuring no information is lost during the update process.

### Code Changes
- The function for generating changelog entries has been replaced with a more generalized approach for handling updates.
- Separate update logic for `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` has been introduced.

This update enhances the workflow by automating the documentation process related to pull requests more comprehensively. All relevant changes in code should now be reflected in both the changelog and the README file, keeping project documentation up to date effortlessly.

## Changelog

### Added
- Implemented support for cities in the weather forecast feature.
  - Introduced a new static array for cities, including major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
  - Updated the `WeatherForecast` model to include a `City` property.
  - Modified `WeatherForecastController` to generate a random city along with the weather forecast data.

### Improvements
- Changed the HTTP GET method name in `WeatherForecastController` from `GetWeatherForecast` to `GetWeatherForecastByCity` for clearer functionality indication.

### Configuration
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the `bin` directory in addition to the `obj` directory for better build hygiene.

### Changelog Update

**Title:** Improve Prompt

**Summary of Changes:**
- Enhanced the prompt in the README generation process to clarify that the output will replace the entire file content. This change aims to provide clearer instructions regarding the purpose and format of the README for the WeatherService project, ensuring that it comprehensively covers all HTTP endpoints and their respective request/response objects.

## Changelog Update

### Improvements
- Enhanced the code review process by implementing a function to generate a combined review for the entire pull request (PR), allowing for a more holistic assessment of changes.
- Updated the `generate_valid_comment_for_file` function to maintain existing functionality, while adding the capability to handle multiple file diffs.
- Increased the maximum tokens for the OpenAI API call to accommodate larger PRs.
- Modified the posting of general comments to include the review comments generated for the entire PR instead of individual model names.

### Code Changes:
- Added `generate_combined_review(diffs)` function to compile all diffs into a single prompt.
- Updated `post_general_comment(pr, comment_body)` to take the combined review comment as input.
- Improved formatting and readability in the `generate_combined_review` function.

### Other Fixes:
- Ensured informative print statements were added for clarity during the review posting process.

These changes collectively enhance the functionality of the code review system, making it more efficient and effective in providing feedback on pull requests as a whole.
